# All-Remote and Remote-First Employment Opportunities and Communities

Explore a collection of all-remote and remote-first companies, as well as job boards featuring top-notch remote positions.

Additionally, we are assembling an expanding list of remote communities that serve as platforms for remote leaders and professionals to connect, exchange ideas, share resources, and discover job prospects.

## A new trend

The trend of working remotely is gaining global momentum, as evidenced by data presented in the [GitLab Remote Work Report](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/remote-work-report/). Although all-remote and remote-first organizations are still in the minority, several factors, including rising rents in major cities, an increased focus on sustainability, and a cultural desire to work and live in fulfilling locations, have led more individuals to express interest in remote work.

Buffer's recent [https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020](State of Remote Work) report indicates that a vast majority of remote workers would recommend this work arrangement to others. Additionally, survey data from Owl Labs, encompassing 23 countries and 6 continents, reveals that over half of global companies now offer some form of remote work.

It's important to note that not all remote work environments are the same, a topic explored in detail on the part-remote page.

According to the Owl Labs survey, 16% of global companies operate fully remotely, and 40% follow a hybrid model, providing remote options while maintaining at least one physical office. Notably, an increasing number of startups and small-to-medium-sized businesses have adopted the all-remote approach. Therefore, individuals seeking to work for an all-remote or remote-first organization, rather than advocating for a remote arrangement within a colocated company, should focus their attention on the career pages mentioned below.
